# About Michael Kafarowski
<img class="profilePhoto largepic imgwborder" src="/assets/img/site/me.jpg" alt="me">
Hi! I'm Michael Kafarowski. I have a passion for exploring new skills and ideas. I love taking things apart, learning how things work, and building and sharing new things. I strive to always improve my technical, non-technical and interpersonal skills.

I work as an embedded electronics and software designer at World Star Technologies, a laser solutions company in Markham Ontario. Here I help develop next-generation laser systems. Working at a small company means I get the opportunity to explore many different aspects of product design, including electronics design and PCB layout with KiCAD, embedded programming in C++ for the STM32 platform, and designing mechanical prototypes with Fusion 360.

In 2019, I graduated from the Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. While at Waterloo I worked on projects such as an underwater ROV with a telemetry-link controller, a precision LVDT instrument, and a modular smart granola snack making machine. I had the pleasure of interning at Metrolinx in Signals, Toronto Transit Commission in Automatic Train Control, Agfa-Gevaert in Hardware Design, and as a new product designer at Metalumen Manufacturing.

On the non-work side, I am currently repairing an old iMac G3 which died over ten years ago. I'm learning a lot about how CRT monitors work and hope that soon it will be up and running again. I enjoy the adrenaline rush of flying first-person-view quadcopters. I grew a pumpkin in my windowsill a few years ago, and baked it into the most satisfying pumpkin pie I've ever eaten. Despite sensitivity to caffeine, each morning I strive towards achieving my goal of making a delicious coffee with latte art that doesn't resemble an evil flower.
