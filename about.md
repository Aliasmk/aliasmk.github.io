# About Michael Kafarowski

Hi! I'm Michael Kafarowski. I have a passion for exploring new skills and ideas. I love taking things apart, learning how things work, and building and sharing new things. I strive to always improve my technical, non-technical and interpersonal skills.

I have recently embarked on a new journey - since June 2023 I have taken a new position as an electronics designer at Crystal Fountains Inc. Crystal Fountains is an international leader in the innovation, design, and manufacturing of architectural water features. I'll be developing the electronics and firmware for new products as well as maintaining and improving existing lines. Key responsibilities of my role are ensuring that designs are well-supported, rigorously tested, highly functional and reliable.

Between 2019 and 2023 I worked as an embedded electronics and software designer at World Star Technologies, a laser solutions company in Markham Ontario. Here I helped develop next-generation laser systems. I had the opportunity to explore many different aspects of product design. My day-to-day activities included electronics design and PCB layout with KiCAD, embedded development in C/C++ for the STM32 and MSP430 platforms, and design of mechanical prototypes with Fusion 360. My activities also extended beyond engineering into areas such as advertisement copywriting, video editing, web development, and more. I'm proud of the team leadership that I expressed through the development and implementation of processes that made our engineering operations more smooth and scalable. Working at World Star Tech challenged me to always be agile, organized and versatile in order to quickly learn and adapt to new tasks, technologies and approaches.

In 2019, I graduated from the Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo. While at Waterloo I worked on projects such as an underwater ROV with a telemetry-link controller, a precision LVDT instrument, and a modular smart granola snack making machine. I also had the pleasure of interning at Metrolinx in Signals, Toronto Transit Commission in Automatic Train Control, Agfa-Gevaert in Hardware Design, and as a new product designer at Metalumen Manufacturing.

I am a licensed radio amateur, callsign ***VA3FMK***. You can sometimes find me on 70cm and 2m repeaters in the GTA. I also regularly monitor 446.000 MHz or 146.520 MHz FM simplex calling frequencies. I use a Yaesu VX-6R 5W handheld with either a half-wave dipole antenna or a "slim jim" roll-up antenna made from balanced ladder line.

Other than all that, I've recently reignited my old hobby of racing slot cars! I also enjoy the adrenaline rush of flying first-person-view (FPV) quadcopters. A few years ago I grew a pumpkin *indoors* in my windowsill, and then baked it into the world's most satisfying pumpkin pie. Despite sensitivity to caffeine, each morning I strive towards achieving my goal of making a delicious coffee with latte art that doesn't resemble an evil flower.
