							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>In pairs, our Introduction to Business year-end project was to create a hypothetical start-up company, complete with estimates for first-quarter income statements and balance sheets. My partner and I settled on a video game production studio that opened the development of video games to fans to submit crowd-sourced content. After the main business end of the project was complete, I set out to individually build a video game as a demo for our trade show. This was the first time I had programmed a full game, and to do it I used Unity3D software. </p>
							<p>100 hours, two graphics cards, and thousands of lines of code later, Pacman 3000 was complete. Starring Pacman in a totally 3D world, the player had to collect coins while navigating the terrain, avoiding ghosts and laser turrets. At their disposal were two powerups: a helicopter cap for extreme jumps, and a jetpack for fast movement.</p>
							<p>The game was a huge success, grabbing the attention of both students and judges. Combined with our sound business model, the judges awarded us a top-three spot in the tradeshow.</p>
