						<h1 >Worked in a team to build a 3D Autonomous Lego Builder</h1>
						<p >As a final project, my group and I were tasked to build a mechatronic system using LEGO Mindstorms NXT. Our decision was to build a LEGO robot that would autonomously build other LEGO designs. The design process was documented and submitted as reports.
						<br>
						The result is probably more impressive to watch than it is to read about, so here is a video of it in action.

						<h1>3D Solid-Modelled and Printed A Custom Cell Phone Stand.</h1>
						<img src="phonestand.jpg" style="float:right; width: 30%; min-width:190px; height:auto; padding-right:15px;">
						<p>This cell phone stand was the final product of applying all that I had learned in Engineering graphics class. It started out as a list of design constraints and criteria, moved into hand-drawn design stages, drafted on AutoCAD, and finally, solid-modeled using Solidworks. 3D printing the stand completed the design pipeline, forming a final product.
						<br>I decided on the Landscape/Portrait tags partly as a humorous hint to an element of Android's camera app. If in video mode, the app will prompt you to rotate your phone to landscape, reminding users not to record in portrait mode. The stand keeps the user informed of the phone's orientation whenever the phone is in it.
						<br>My second Instructables.com how-to guide is currently in progress, and will detail both the design process as well as steps to creating such a stand from scratch.
