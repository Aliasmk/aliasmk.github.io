						<h1>ALIAneS - Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator</h1>
						<div class="article">
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is a video game console released in 1985. With over 61 million units sold, it was the #1 best selling video game console for almost 10 years until the release of the original Playstation.</p>
							<p>ALIAneS is an NES emulator I developed to learn about how early computers and video game consoles worked at a hardware and software level. The emulator core was written entirely from scratch in C++ over the course of a few years. The name is a combination of 'alias' and 'NES'.</p>

							<h2>Project Inception and Technologies</h2>
							<p>The ALIAneS project began in August 2014 after I came across an abandoned tutorial for writing a 4-bit CPU emulator. Although the tutorial blog was abandoned by it's author after only a few posts, it gave me enough knowledge to form a starting point for developing an emulator of my own.</p> 
							<p>I chose to design an emulator for the NES for a few reasons. Firstly, I love video games, and I love hardware, so I wanted to learn how early game consoles worked at a software and hardware level. Secondly, I felt that an NES emulator was an excellent middle ground between these interests  and a system simplistic enough to not get too overwhelmed with the technicalities. The 8-bit nature of the CPU meant that there was a relatively small and simple instruction set. In addition, the 6502 is a very well documented processor, and there existed a wealth of knowledge and information online.</p>
							<p>I started the project right before my first year of university. One of my courses in first year was to be a C++ programming course, so I chose C++ for this project to get my feet wet before classes started.</p>
							<p>Although the emulator core was written entirely from scratch, I chose to use the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to provide a cross-platform window management and input capture solution.</p>

							<h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
							<p>The first challenge I encountered was that of gathering information. Not only did I start out knowing nothing about the NES, I can say in hindsight that didn’t even know a lot of what I didn’t know! Luckily the NES and the 6502 CPU is very well documented, and resources such as the nesdev.com forums and wiki made the research very easy.</p>

							<h2>What I Learned</h2>
							<p>This project was an extremely valuable learning experience. Emulators had always felt like magic to me and I never thought I would be able to write one. However, I learned that like many other engineering problems, challenges can be overcome by breaking things down into smaller, more manageable problems.</p>
							<p>I learned a significant amount about the technical details of emulation, the NES, and the 6502 CPU – too much to list here. See my blog post entitled How to Write an Emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System, releasing in March 2019.</p>

							<h2>ALIAneS In Action</h2>
							<p>ALIAneS can be cloned from my Github. It currently builds on Ubuntu – some modification to the makefile will probably be required to build on macOS and Windows.</p>
							<p style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; text-align:center;">git clone https://github.com/Aliasmk/ALIAneS-Emulator.git</p>
							<p>If you would rather watch it in action, the video below shows ALIAneS running Donkey Kong.</p>
