							<p>Anyone who was in elementary school during the 2000's probably knew someone who had one of these SpyGear tracker systems. In fact, if you had one, you were probably the coolest kid in sixth grade. Both my sister and I had one of these, and it was definitely one of our favorite spy toys back then.
								<br><br>However, in terms of real practicality, the sensors were huge and awfully conspicuous, which often voids thier usefulness in a super-stealth scenario. There is a need for sensors that would get the job done but not stand out.
								I modded the original sensor and base station to fit inside Altoids tins, and documented the process on Instructables.com. 
								<br><br>
								The result was a an inconspicuous sensor and station combination that could be hidden in plain sight on a desk or counter.
