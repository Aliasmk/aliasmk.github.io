						<h1>No-Microcontroller EEPROM Reader</h1>

							<a href="/projects/">Return to Projects</a>
							<p>A few years ago I desoldered an EEPROM from something I was salvaging parts from. I decided it would be interesting if I could use pushbuttons and LEDs in place of datalines from a microcontroller to control the EEPROM.
								<br><br>I had a button for the Clock Pulse, a button for Data In, a switch for Chip Select and an LED for data out. At first I failed because the pushbuttons created "bounce" which was especially a problem for the clock, where each press would actually trigger dozens of clock cycles. I decided instead to replace the clock button with a 555 timer. I believe a low pass filter would have worked as well, but I didn't try it.
								<br><br>This project was done mostly to demonstrate how chips are interfaced with by microcontrollers, on a very slow time scale. This is obviously not a practical way to read or program an EEPROM!
								<br><br>Essentially the chip checks for a signal on the data in line every time the clock pulses. If it sees a particular sequence of 0s and 1s, it executes different instructions (such as read, write, erase etc), with different parameters (data to write, address to write to).

							<p>Note the 5M resistor is just a few 1Ms in series.... I'm still working on more elegant 555 circuits as you can probably imagine :)</p>
