							<h2>NoEye Haptic Clock <span style="color:#777;">(2018 - In Progress)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/eyesfreeclock.gif" alt="No-Eye-Clock Icon"/>
							</div>
							<p>Regularly faced with the problem of waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to open my eyes to read a normal clock, I designed a clock that uses an alternative method to communicate the time.</p>

							<h2>5" FPV Racing Quadcopter <span style="color:#777;">(2018)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/tyranttop.jpg" alt="Quadcopter Icon"/>
							</div>
							<p>I have been a fan of R/C cars and helicopters for a long time, and was fascinated by the speed and agility of racing quadcopters when they first appeared on the market. As my first foray into the hobby and to learn more about these machines, I built my own 5" FPV racing quadcopter.</p>

							<h2>RS-485 ROV Controller with Telemetry Link <span style="color:#777;">(2017)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/controller.jpg" alt="ROV Controller Icon"/>
							</div>
							<p>As part of a design project to build an ROV to navigate an underwater course, I designed an AVR-based controller to drive the ROV by tele-operation over RS-485. In addition to the tele-op mode it also features a telemetry readout from sensors aboard the ROV and a macro record/playback function.</p>

							<h2>ALIAneS Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator <span style="color:#777;">(2014 - 2016)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/alianesanimate.gif" alt="Alianes Icon"/>
							</div>
							<p>This is a work in progress (but functional!) emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). 
							Using it you can play games such as Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong from cartridge ROM memory dump files on your computer.
							It emulates all official opcodes of the 6502 Microprocessor. It emulates the 2C07 Picture Processing Unit on a scanline-by-scanline level, though this code is still in development.</p>

							<h2>LED Strip PWM Controller <span style="color:#777;">(2016)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/pwm/pwm.jpg" alt="PWM Board Icon"/>
							</div>
							<p>This controller board was developed to efficiently dim an off-the-shelf 12V LED strip, for use as accent lighting on a boat. I designed the circuit and PCB from scratch, and assembled and tested it myself.</p>

							<h2>No-Î¼Controller EEPROM Reader <span style="color:#777;">(2016)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/eeprom.png" alt="EEPROM Reader"/>
							</div>
							<p>An experiment in alternative techniques over the use of microcontrollers to interface with memory integrated circuits over the SPI protocol. Even though it is not a practical way of using these ICs, it is good educational "slow motion" look at the signals.</p>

							<h2>Linear Variable Differential Transformer <span style="color:#777;">(2015)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/lvdt.jpg" alt="LVDT"/>
							</div>
							<p>Based on the principles of electromagnetic coupling, LVDTs are capable of extremely high precision measurements. 
							In a team of four we built one from scratch using scrap parts and various electronics components including an op-amps as a signal amplifier and an Arduino for signal processing.</p>

							<h2>Solid Modelled and 3D Printed Cellphone Stand <span style="color:#777;">(2014)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/phonestand.jpg" alt="Cell Stand"/>
							</div>
							<p>This cell phone stand was the final project for my first year engineering concepts course. It started out as a list of design constraints and criteria, moved through hand-drawn design stages, drafted on AutoCAD, and finally, solid-modeled using Solidworks. 3D printing the stand completed the design pipeline, forming a final product. I outlined the process in an Instructables.com article. </p>

							<h2>Java Infinite Monkey Theorem Model <span style="color:#777;">(2013-2014)</span></h2>
							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/imt.png" alt="IMT"/>
							</div>
							<p>This application simulates the Infinite Monkey theory (which states that a monkey, typing into infinity will eventually type a well known piece of literature) by creating sentence-like gibberish and finding english words. It has evolved from its first form to become much faster by implementing more efficient search algorithms.</p>

							<div class="contentPhoto floatLeft">
								<img src="./projectimages/pm3000.jpg" alt="PM3000"/>
							</div>
							<p>Pacman 3000 was developed as a demo for a grade 9 business trade show.<br>Starring Pacman in a totally 3D world, the player must collect coins while navigating the terrain, avoiding ghosts and laser turrets.</p>
