							<p>My specific major role in this project was overall group leadership and construction of the rollercoaster. My track design consisted of two parallel lengths of copper piping. Copper was selected as a material due to its malleability, as well as strength (relative to the alternative which was plastic aquarium tubing, the material chosen by all other groups). The track was built by placing the rolls of copper piping side by side and carefully unwrapping it into the shape of the rollercoaster, soldering the track to copper supports as I went. This method evolved followed various failed attempts where the track was too bumpy to work consistently. 
						 	<br><br>Overall this project was a success, deadlines were all met in good time, and we received a mark of 95% overall for the report and model, which to this day works as well as it did when it was first built. Through this project I not only learned how to apply physics to everyday situations, but also how to build a large model, and how to shape and solder copper.
