desc: Regularly faced with the problem of waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to open my eyes to read a normal clock, I designed a clock that uses an alternative method to communicate the time. The user can choose from a haptic mode - where the time is relayed by a sequence of vibration pulses - or audio mode, where the clock speaks the time out loud.

# HapticEye Haptic Clock
<img src="/assets/img/projects/HapticEyeV3.jpg" class="profilePhoto largepic"/>
I'm a pretty light sleeper - I wake up pretty often during the night and sometimes have trouble going back to sleep, so I'd like to be able to know what time it is to see whether or not it's worth trying to fall back asleep. To check the time, I have to basically force my eyes open to check my phone, which more often than not is still on full brightness from the previous day.

The goal of the No-Eye Clock project is to provide a mechanism for 'reading' the time without having to look at it.
