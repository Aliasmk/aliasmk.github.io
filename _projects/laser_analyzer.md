desc: The Laser Analyzer is an advanced and user-friendly tool to test laser diodes in production environments. In seconds it plots the diode's output power, voltage and feedback photocurrent as a function of input current. I acted as the project leader and was a majority contributer to the STM32 C++ codebase, where I programmed low-level hardware, the user interface, and high-level application logic. Other end-to-end contributions include mechanical design and prototyping, PCB layout, board bring-up, documentation, ad copy, product videos, and more.
