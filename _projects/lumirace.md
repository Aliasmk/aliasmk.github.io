Slot cars bodies have become highly detailed and realistic, but most drivers miss out on a key detail - lights. LumiRace is a lighting kit designed for maximum realism and immersion. Other lighting kits only glow passively or worse, turn off when the car stops. LumiRace reacts intelligently and realistically, illuminating tail lights specifically when the car is decelerating or stationary, just like a real vehicle. LumiRace uses special sensing technology to detect when the car de-slots, and will turn on blinking hazard lights until it is replaced on the track. The optional integrated light sensor automatically adjusts the brightness of the headlights for ambient lighting conditions.

An on-board rechargeable battery powers the system both on and off the track. The lights illuminate when power is applied for the first time, and once removed from the track the lights will remain on for a configurable period of time.

LumiRace doesn't need to be soldered, making it incredibly easy to install. Simply wire it to the braid in parallel with the motor. With the easy-to-use PC software you can easily customize the brightness and behavior of all the lights. Use it choose between different modes such as Daylight Running, where the tail lights glow faintly while the car isn't braking.
