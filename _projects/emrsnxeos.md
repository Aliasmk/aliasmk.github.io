desc: A collaboration with <a href="https://ekafarowski.com" target="_blank">Emerson Kafarowski</a>, the EMRSNxEOS Moving Light Controller is an open-source portable programming wing for use with theatrical lighting systems. Lighting consoles are generally large and expensive, limiting their use in small and non-traditional venues. The goal is to build a customizable hardware platform for lighting designers that maintains the efficiency and ease of use granted by more expensive lighting consoles. The system is developed in C++ for the ESP32, and communicates with the EOS lighting software using Open Sound Control (OSC).
