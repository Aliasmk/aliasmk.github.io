desc: This soil tracker helps you grow healthier plants by clearly showing how your plant is drinking, and when you need to water next. Unlike other moisture meters, it is designed to be left in the plant 24/7 without corroding, reducing the damage to roots caused by repeated checks. The STM32 microcontroller measures the capacitance of a custom probe inserted into the soil, calculates the moisture content and displays the results on a crisp e-paper display. A minimalistic interface promotes a closer, distraction-free connection with the plant itself.
